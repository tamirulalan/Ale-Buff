=====How to play====

This game will be played between two different players. In this case between me and computer. Before we start the game both players save two numbers less than 5. The numbers must be different (say x for user and y for computer). Then we have five fingers representing numbers from one to five. The user player('me' in this case) can choose these numbers by clicking on any fingers he/she wants. In the same way the computer select randomly one number from one to five. After this both numbers added together and check who win the game. If the sum nymber is equal with "x" which is my number I (the user) will win the game and my score goes up. But if the sum number is equal with "y" which is computer number the computer win the game AND computer score goes up. Other wise you will draw and no score change. 

For this game the maximum attempt for one time game is 20
